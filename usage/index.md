# Usage of our Database

Our database is Open Source and can be used for free with credit.
This part may start to get a bit technical so if you're up for it, hold tight!

1. [Where the data is stored](/finddata.html)
2. [How to get the data](/getdata.html)
3. [Using the data and displaying it](/displaydata.html)

Follow by order to be able to understand the documentation, unless, of course, you know what you are doing.
